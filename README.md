# README

### KeepSight is a simple project that implements React and Ruby on Rails to provide a simple way to design and organize photos and video of specific children(or even pets).

### With a simple GUI built using TailwindCSS and DaisyUI, website navigation is simple.


## This project is currently not deployed and only runs locally.
## To run it, follow the instructions below


## Running Locally
To get started, clone this repository to your machine.

Once cloned, change into the directory of the repository.

When you are in the directory of the repo on your local machine, run the followind commands.
```console
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
```

You can then start the rails server in this tab by running the command `rails s`.

Now in another tab of the same directory, you can run the command `npm start --prefix client` to start the React app on your local machine.

This should automatically boot up a tab with the website up and running.

You are now free to use the app as you wish.
